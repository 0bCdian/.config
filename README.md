# Gruvbox Gnome

## Gtk theme

- I use [this](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme) theme for gnome, I assume you already know how to install them.

## Fetching 

- I use a little program called [fetching](https://github.com/robole/fetching) to display ascii art in my terminal, instructions are in the original repo.

## Icon Theme

- For icons my go to choice is [papirus dark](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) with the brown folders option, again, instructions on how to install are on the original repo.

## Gnome Extensions

- Blur my shell
- Dash to dock for cosmic
- bluetooth quick connect
- just perfection
- rounded window corners
- sound input & output device chooser
- user themes (you need this one to change the gtk themes in gnome)

## Firefox theme
- I use the [gruvfox theme](https://github.com/FirefoxCSSThemers/GruvFox) with [betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox) with the tabliss extension.

## Apps and miscalleneous 

- [Cider](https://cider.sh/) an apple music client
- [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) the theme I have is here in my repo
- Fonts: CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font for rofi, vscode and terminal, ubuntu font for everything else.
